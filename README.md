# Data-Visualisation-Tata-Group-by-Forage
In this Virtual internship programme I used Excel, Tableau and Microsoft PPT for data cleaning, data analyzing, data visualization and creating data insights to answer business related questions.

Tata Group is a global conglomerate which operates in more than 100 countries across six continents, with a mission 'To improve the quality of life of the communities we serve globally, through long-term stakeholder value creation based on Leadership with Trust’. With a revenue of $128 billion (INR 9.6 trillion) in 2021-22, the companies collectively employ over 935,000 people. There are 29 publicly listed Tata enterprises – many being market leaders in their industries.
